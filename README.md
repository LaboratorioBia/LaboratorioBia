¡Perfecto! Aquí te dejo una estructura para el README de tu repositorio en GitHub, que documenta claramente las conclusiones y directrices para que cualquier desarrollador que llegue a la empresa sepa cómo organizar los desarrollos.

# Company Development Guidelines

## Overview

This repository serves as a central hub for all the coding and development standards within the company. It provides clear guidelines for naming conventions, repository structure, reusable components, and the documentation for each project or service.

## Repository Structure and Naming Conventions

### General Naming Conventions

To standardize project naming across different repositories, follow the structure below:

- **Microservices:** `APP_name_service`
- **RPA Automations:** `RPA_name_rpa`
- **Dashboards:** `DASH_name_dashboard`
- **Frontend Applications:** `FRONT_name_front`

Example:
- `APP_CustomerService`
- `RPA_OrderProcessing`
- `DASH_SalesOverview`
- `FRONT_WebPortal`

### Repository Folders

Each service or module should reside in its own repository to maintain modularity and facilitate version control. For smaller or general-purpose services, a shared repository may be used.

- **One repository per microservice**: Each critical or standalone microservice should have its own repository.
- **Shared repository for smaller services**: Small, generic services can be grouped together in a "monorepo" for general utilities.

### Example Repositories
- `Logistics/Dashboards`: Contains all dashboards related to logistics operations.
- `Logistics/AutomationsRPA`: Repository for all RPA automations within the logistics area.
- `Negotiations/AutomationsRPA`: Repository for RPA automations within the negotiations area.

## Reusable Components

### Core Data Central (`CoreDataCentral`)

`CoreDataCentral` is a reusable class that connects to SAP's CDS to retrieve information. It is designed to be shared across multiple projects. This class is stored in the **SharedModules** repository and can be integrated into any service that requires access to SAP data.

### How to Use in Projects

1. **Import the Class:**
   - For Python: Add the dependency to your `requirements.txt` or install via pip:
     ```bash
     pip install coredatacentral
     ```
   - For Node.js: Install the package using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install coredatacentral
     ```

2. **Documentation**: Refer to the `SharedModules/CoreDataCentral` repository for detailed documentation on how to integrate and use this class.

### Versioning

All reusable components, including `CoreDataCentral`, will follow semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). Ensure that your project specifies the required version to avoid compatibility issues.

## Development Workflow

### Repository Guidelines

- **Microservices**: One repository per service to ensure independent deployment and scaling.
- **Smaller Services**: These can be grouped in a shared repository under `GeneralServices/` or similar.
  
### Continuous Integration

We use CI/CD pipelines to automate the process of testing, building, and deploying microservices and reusable components. Each repository is linked to our CI/CD pipeline, ensuring every change is tested before it reaches production.

## For New Developers

Welcome to the team! Below is a quickstart guide to help you get started:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**: Follow the setup instructions in the `onboarding.md` file.
2. **Understand the Naming Conventions**: All repositories and components follow specific naming standards (see the section on naming conventions).
3. **Check Reusable Components**: Before writing new code, check if there's an existing module or class you can reuse from the `SharedModules` repository.
4. **Version Control**: Ensure that you use GitHub branches and follow the versioning standards for each project.

For any questions or clarifications, please reach out to your team lead or check the `docs` folder for more detailed documentation.

### Future Improvements

- **Modularization of Services**: We are constantly improving our microservice architecture and may introduce new modules for better scalability and performance.
- **Centralized Documentation**: A full developer documentation site is under construction, and will be linked here once available.
